# GoldChallenge

This repository holds three completed projects from the GoldBadge Challenge. 
These challenges are named Cafe, Greeting, and Green Project. Each of them has 
a library, test assembly for testing methods within the library, and a console
application for running the code.

The Cafe project allows one to create, read, and delete meals within their menu.

The Greeting project allows one to create, read, update, and delete customers within 
their customer list. In addition to these functions, the Greeting application also
displays a tailor made message to customers based upon whether they are a past current,
or potential customer.

The Green Project allows one to create, read, view details, update, and delete electric, hybrid, and
gas-fed cars. Each car type has their own library and test methods. They all share the 
same console application.
